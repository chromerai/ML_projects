# ML_projects
This repository contains projects related to various machine Learning algorithms and their usage via some projects .
I am currently a student trying to understand this vast domain of machine learning and deep learning . These are some simple projects that provide necessary understanding of basic concepts like Knn classification , linear regression , logistic regression and many more !!!!!!

These projects are useful for those who are new to this field and working hard to explore but feel stuck.

The projects here are to present 'how to use the algorithms' and viewers ae urged to understand them and then formulate their own projects . 
Also I will try to upload their optimum solutions soon , but in a new repository and will give the link here : 

Definitely feel free to suggest corrections, I will definitely try to incorporate them and lets just help each other in learning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

submission01 uses Knn in order to classify a whether a car purchased is a good buy or a bad buy depending upon the features listed. 
The dataset used is part of the kaggle competition : https://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked/data

NYC Taxi fare Starter Kernal : uses linear regression to predict the taxi fares. The dataset used is part of kaggle competition : https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction

house_price_prediction_simple_linear : uses linear regression to predict the taxi fares. The dataset used is part of kaggle competition : https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques This dataset requires advanced refression techniques and can very well display the limitations of Linear Regression techniques .

ghouls-goblins-Neural net uses keras sequential model and dense layers to create a neural net to classify data into ghouls - goblins -ghosts .
