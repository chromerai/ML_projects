# ML_projects
This repository contains projects related to various machine Learning algorithms and their usage via some projects .
I am currently a student trying to understand this vast domain of machine learning and deep learning . These are some simple projects that provide necessary understanding of basic concepts like Knn classification , linear regression , logistic regression and many more !!!!!!
These projects are useful for those who are new to this field and working hard to explore but feel stuck. 
Definitely feel free to suggest corrections, I will definitely try to incorporate them and lets just help each other in learning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
